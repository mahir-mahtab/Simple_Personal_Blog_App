# Understanding React Server Components

React Server Components (RSC) are changing how we build React apps. This post dives into their benefits and usage.

## What Are RSC?
- Components rendered on the server
- Reduced bundle size
- Improved performance

## Example
```jsx
export default function ServerComponent() {
  return <div>Rendered on the server!</div>;
}
```

## Best Practices

- Avoid client-only logic in RSC
