# Welcome to My Blog

This is my **first post** written in markdown! Here are some things I can do:

## Rich Text Formatting

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `Code snippets`
- [Links](https://nextjs.org)

## Code Blocks

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Lists and More

1. Ordered lists
2. Are easy to create
3. And look great

> Blockquotes are perfect for highlighting important information.

This markdown approach gives me much more flexibility for writing blog posts with proper formatting, code highlighting, and rich content structure.
